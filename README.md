# Wing-Cap
A program that compares your speed run segment times to your choice of tutorial benchmarks, top runner splits, or other records and automatically advises which segments need the most practice. Intended to be very simple and easy to use so that the speed runner can focus on speed running and not analyzing data.
The code will initially be written to work with Super Mario 64, but in the future could be expanded to work with other speed running games as well.

Basic idea:
- The player selects their game, intended category, and skill level.
- The program then pulls the appropriate benchmark times from a database and places them in a table for the player to view.
- The player inserts their times into the program and the program records these times and the date the time was achieved.
- The program lets the player know which segments need the most improvement to match the selected benchmark.
- The program also uses date information to alert the player what they haven't practiced in a while and could use refreshing.

Features that would be nice to implement:
- A screen capturing function that automatically records segment times from gameplay, allowing even easier use.

Ideas from the SM64 and speed running community as a whole are welcomed and encouraged!
I would love to see this project really take off and become an asset to anyone wanting to improve their speedrun times.

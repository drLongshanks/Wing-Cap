# Project WingCap
# Author: Dr_Longshanks
#
# A program to assist speedrunners in focusing their practice sessions on parts of the game (segments) that need
# the most work, as determined by their own segment times and those of user-selected benchmarks.
# A user selects their language, skill level, desired category, platform, and region. These will be saved and used to
# access relevant data in some database.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# On startup, the program should test whether or not the user already has configured their profile.

# Send player to a setup screen if no config file is available.

# Send player into main program upon finding a valid config file.

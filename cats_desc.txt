    Most common categories are listed between "BASE" and "OTHER". Will be implemented before "OTHER" categories in the interest of reaching the largest population first. Fun fact, at the time of this note, 2/16/2022, the number of players running Category Extensions, according to speedrun.com, is %75 lower than the main categories.
    Categories under "OTHER" will not be supported initially. That sure would be a lot of work for my first
real coding project. I would, however, like to support these categories in the future.
